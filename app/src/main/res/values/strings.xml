        to receive the messages WITHOUT any ENCRYPTION on your desktop. Do not forget to
        open the port in your firewall. Give this Android App \'Notify to UDP\' access to
        your notifications. Use 255.255.255.255 for UDP broadcast. Sometimes this does
        not work and you need the hostname or IP-Address (both not iplement in udp2notify yet)
        of the device running udp2notify daemon.</string>
